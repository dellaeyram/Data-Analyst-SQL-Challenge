Q. 8. CREATE TABLE volume (country text NOT NULL,kind text NOT NULL,volume integer NOT NULL-- more stuff :)); 
Comment: and this very one will give as the total volume,
SELECT country "country", kind,
SUM (Volume) "Send_amount_scalar"
FROM SELECT volume
GROUP BY country;

Q.9. ALTER TABLE volume
ADD transaction_count integer NOT NULL,
         Unique_senders integer PRIMARY KEY;
